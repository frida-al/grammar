# Context & Description
Grammars are 'a set of instructions about how to write statements that are valid for a programming language' (Grandinetti, 2019). This set of instructions are rules that dictate the order of characters and words in senteneces so that these will be valid.

For this evidence, I will develop a context free grammar based on the German language.
