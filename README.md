# Context & Description
Grammars are 'a set of instructions about how to write statements that are valid for a programming language' (Grandinetti, 2019). This set of instructions are rules that dictate the order of characters and words in senteneces so that these will be valid.

For this evidence, I will develop a context-free grammar based on the German language, specifically, the basic sentence structure in German. For the main sentence, I will be handling the structure S -> Sub V Comp, that stands for Sub = subjetc, V = verb and Comp = complement. The complemente will generate most of the complexity of this grammar, given that is the only non-terminal in the main sentence. 
Here are the words translations I will be working with:

## Subjects
Ich
: I
Du 
: you (informal)
Sie 
: You (formal)
Er
: he

## Verbs

## Chomsky Hierarchy
Professor Noam Chomsky is an American professor and public intellectual known for his work in linguistics, political activism, and social criticism. He is also know as "the father of modern linguistics". Even if in the beginning his work was mainly focused on the analysis of languages, it is now relevant to computer science, since it helps analyze programming languages and understand more complex languages. 
The Chomsky Hierarchy states that the Type 3 grammars are restricted and not so powerful, while Type 0 grammars are completly unrestricted and can be recognized by a Turing Machine.
The grammar I have worked on for this evidence is catalogued as a Context-Free grammar, or Type 2 according to the Chomsky Hierarchy. This, on one hand, is because I have eliminated non-terminals on the left side of the grammar. On the other hand, given that the grammar has both terminals and non terminas on its right side, it canÂ´t classify as a Type 0 grammar, a regular grammar.
